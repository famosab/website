Building a blog with ablog, github-pages and github-actions
===========================================================

* I had to configure an SSH key to make :bash:`ablog deploy` work, with the setup described below this will no longer be needed. 
* I can edit the blog and have a preview with :bash:`ablog build` and :bash:`ablog serve`. If i am satisfied with result, I can add, commit and push the changes.
* I separated the source of the website (the files written in rst) and the repository which hosts the website (html files) and connected those with a github actions script called :file:`deploy.yml`.
* I added my API-TOKEN to the secrets of the :file:`website` repository (the repo where I push from) as described `here <https://github.com/cpina/github-action-push-to-another-repository>`_. This is needed for the github actions script called :file:`deploy.yml`
* The :file:`.nojekyll` is necessary to have the blog rendered correctly.
