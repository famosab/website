About Me
============================

I am a bioinformatics master student at the University of Tuebingen. 

I spend most of my time working on `metabolic models and their validation <https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/systembiologie/start/welcome/>`_.

When I am not trying to fix errors in SBML, I like to spend my time on science communication projects. I contribute to the `Faktor 14 Magazin <https://www.faktor14magazin.de/>`_ and co-founded the `StudSciCom Initiative <https://www.stud-scicom.de/>`_. I also enjoy teaching and have held multiple tutorials at my university (in mathematics and about object oriented programming in java) as well as courses for high-school students in germany in mathematics preparing them for their 'Abitur'.
