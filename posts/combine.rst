Takeaways from my first conference
==================================

Master students are usually not the ones going to conferences. They either do not have enough time to go (e.g. a thesis will take you 6 months) or not enough results to even put together a poster much less a talk. When my supervisor mentioned the `COMBINE Meetup <https://combine-org.github.io/events/>`_ to me, I decided that this would be a great opportunity to learn more about standards in systems biology, present my work on a python module called refineGEMs (which will hopefully be available soon) and connect with people from the community.

Even tough I was told beforehand that this meetup would be rather small, I was not expecting to be able to really contribute to discussions about developement of the standards. But fortunately I was proven wrong. Not only was I able to join small group discussions, I also got to explain what I am working on as well as discussing obstacles that I faced during my work. After the first day I was happy enough to even post on Twitter about that and I rarely do that.

It was really encouraging to see all these people who were exited about things that I am also interested in. In the end I made many connections and this might have brought me one step further on my journey to finding a PhD position that fits. I would recommend to go to a conference even if you might feel like you do not have enough expertise in whatever field you are working in. Even if that is true (which I highly doubt) - a conference is a pretty good place to learn new stuff.
